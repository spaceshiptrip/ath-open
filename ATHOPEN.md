```

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| `HashRouter` | GitHub Pages returns 404 on direct sub-path loads; hash routing avoids this |
| All API calls are HTTP GET | Google Apps Script Web Apps handle CORS automatically for GET; POST requires CORS preflight which Apps Script doesn't support |
| `VITE_SHEETS_API_URL` env var | When unset, app falls back to in-app mock data — full local dev with no backend needed |
| Images imported as ES modules | Vite applies content hashing and correct base-path resolution automatically |
| Courts photo compressed PNG→JPG | Original was 4.3 MB; Pillow resized to 1400px and JPEG-compressed to 124 KB (97% reduction) |
| `vite.config.js` base = `/ath-open/` | Matches the GitHub Pages sub-path for the `spaceshiptrip/ath-open` repo |

---

## 3. What Has Been Built (completed work)

### 3.1 Project scaffolding
- Vite 5 + React 18 + Tailwind 3 project initialized from scratch
- `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` configured
- Custom Tailwind color tokens: `pickle-*` (greens) and `ball` (yellow `#f5c518`)
- `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.venv/`
- `.env.example` documents the one required env var

### 3.2 Frontend — pages (6 routes)

| Route | File | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| `/#/` | `src/pages/Home.jsx` | ✅ Done | Courts hero photo, venue badge, live win totals, CTA buttons, teams + rules cards |
| `/#/register` | `src/pages/Register.jsx` | ✅ Done | Full form: name, team A/B toggle, gender toggle, phone, email, headshot URL |
| `/#/teams` | `src/pages/Teams.jsx` | ✅ Done | Two-column roster, Team B shows Dodgers logo in header |
| `/#/schedule` | `src/pages/Schedule.jsx` | ✅ Done | 8 rounds × 2 courts, Mix Doubles highlighted in gold |
| `/#/scores` | `src/pages/Scores.jsx` | ✅ Done | Live standings, toggle "Enter Scores" mode, A Wins / B Wins buttons per match |
| `/#/rules` | `src/pages/Rules.jsx` | ✅ Done | Full rules from tournament document, organized into sections |

### 3.3 Frontend — components (5)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/Header.jsx` | Sticky dark-green nav; Athenaeum logo in white pill left; mobile hamburger; active-route highlight |
| `src/components/Footer.jsx` | Athenaeum logo + tournament name + date/time |
| `src/components/PlayerCard.jsx` | Player headshot (or initials avatar); team badge; captain badge; compact mode for inline lists |
| `src/components/MatchCard.jsx` | Shows round/court, Mix Doubles flag, pair names, result badge, A/B Win buttons (edit mode only), clear button |
| `src/components/Standings.jsx` | Team A vs Team B wins side-by-side; "LEADING" badge; games-completed counter |

### 3.4 Frontend — services & data

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/api.js` | All API calls; auto-falls back to mock data when `VITE_SHEETS_API_URL` not set |
| `src/hooks/useApi.js` | Generic React hook: `useApi('getPlayers')` returns `{ data, loading, error, reload }` |
| `src/data/mockData.js` | 16 sample players (8 per team, Suzan + Cora as captains) and all 16 match slots |
| `src/config.js` | Tournament constants (name, date, times, team captains); `RULES` array; env var export |

### 3.5 Backend — Google Apps Script (`backend/code.gs`)

Complete Apps Script ready to paste into the Google Apps Script editor. Implements:

| Function | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `doGet(e)` | Router | Routes all API requests by `e.parameter.action` |
| `getPlayers()` | GET | Returns all rows from Players sheet as JSON array |
| `registerPlayer(params)` | GET | Appends new player row with auto-generated ID + timestamp |
| `getMatches()` | GET | Returns all rows from Schedule sheet; coerces `isMix` to boolean |
| `updateScore(matchId, winner)` | GET | Finds match row by ID, writes winner value to column I |
| `getStandings()` | GET | Counts A/B wins from Schedule sheet; returns `{ A: n, B: n }` |
| `initSheets()` | Setup | Creates Players + Schedule tabs with headers + formatting; pre-populates all 16 match slots |
| `ensureSheet()` | Helper | Creates sheet if missing, adds bold green header row, freezes row 1 |
| `rowToObj()` | Helper | Converts a sheet row array + header array into a plain JS object |

### 3.6 Google Sheets structure

**Must be set up once before going live. Run `initSheets()` in Apps Script editor to auto-create.**

#### Players tab
| Col | Field | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| A | id | `p1750000000000` |
| B | firstName | `Suzan` |
| C | lastName | `King` |
| D | team | `A` |
| E | gender | `F` |
| F | isCaptain | `TRUE` |
| G | headshotUrl | `https://...` or blank |
| H | phone | `(555) 555-5555` |
| I | email | `suzan@example.com` |
| J | timestamp | `2026-06-28T08:00:00.000Z` |

#### Schedule tab
| Col | Field | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| A | id | `m1` |
| B | round | `1` |
| C | court | `S` |
| D | isMix | `FALSE` |
| E | teamAP1 | Player ID or blank |
| F | teamAP2 | Player ID or blank |
| G | teamBP1 | Player ID or blank |
| H | teamBP2 | Player ID or blank |
| I | winner | `A`, `B`, or blank |

#### Pre-populated match slots

| Match | Round | Court | Mix Doubles |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| m1  | 1 | S | No  |
| m2  | 1 | N | No  |
| m3  | 2 | S | No  |
| m4  | 2 | N | No  |
| m5  | 3 | S | **Yes ★** |
| m6  | 3 | N | **Yes ★** |
| m7  | 4 | S | **Yes ★** |
| m8  | 4 | N | No  |
| m9  | 5 | S | No  |
| m10 | 5 | N | No  |
| m11 | 6 | S | **Yes ★** |
| m12 | 6 | N | **Yes ★** |
| m13 | 7 | S | No  |
| m14 | 7 | N | No  |
| m15 | 8 | S | No  |
| m16 | 8 | N | No  |

### 3.7 Branding & assets

| Asset | File | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Athenaeum logo | `src/assets/athenaeum_header_logo.png` | ✅ In use | Burgundy script on white; shown in header pill and footer |
| Courts photo | `src/assets/athenaeum_pickle_courts.jpg` | ✅ In use | Hero background on Home page; compressed from 4.3 MB PNG → 124 KB JPG |
| Team B logo | `src/assets/team-b-logo.jpg` | ✅ In use | LA Dodgers logo; shown in Teams page Team B header + Home page team badge |
| Team A logo | — | ❌ Not yet | TBD — placeholder is a red circle with "A" |

### 3.8 CI/CD — GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- **Trigger:** push to `main` branch, or manual "Run workflow"
- **Steps:** checkout → Node 20 → `npm ci` → `npm run build` → configure-pages → upload artifact → deploy-pages
- **Secret required:** `VITE_SHEETS_API_URL` (set in repo Settings → Secrets → Actions)
- **Live URL:** https://spaceshiptrip.github.io/ath-open/
- **Status:** ✅ Working — first successful deploy June 21, 2026 (initial run failed because GitHub Pages source wasn't set to "GitHub Actions" yet; fixed by changing Pages setting then re-running the workflow)

### 3.9 Theme & colors

| Token | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| `pickle-900` | `#0f2b1c` | Header, footer, hero overlay |
| `pickle-700` | `#1d4f35` | Active nav background |
| `pickle-600` | `#236040` | Primary buttons, links |
| `pickle-500` | `#2d7d4f` | Accent green |
| `ball` | `#f5c518` | Yellow accent — logo text, active nav, Mix Doubles badges |
| `red-600` | Tailwind | Team A color (all badges, avatars, headers, score buttons) |
| `blue-600/700` | Tailwind | Team B color (all badges, avatars, headers, score buttons) |
| `gray-50` | Tailwind | Page background |

**Note:** Team colors were originally A=blue/B=red, then swapped to A=red/B=blue on June 21 because Team B has the Dodgers (blue) logo.

## 5. Local Development

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spaceshiptrip/ath-open.git
cd ath-open
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173/ath-open/
```

App runs fully on mock data. No Google Sheets or env vars needed.

### Connect to live Google Sheets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
# VITE_SHEETS_API_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
npm run dev
```

---

## 6. Google Sheets Setup (one-time, before tournament)

### A. Create the spreadsheet
1. Go to https://sheets.google.com → create new spreadsheet
2. Name it **ATH Open Pickleball**
3. Copy the Spreadsheet ID from the URL bar:
   `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE`**`/edit`

### B. Add the Apps Script
1. In the spreadsheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**
2. Delete all default content in `Code.gs`
3. Paste the full contents of `backend/code.gs`
4. At the top of the file, set: `const SS_ID = 'SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE';`
5. Save (Ctrl/Cmd+S), name the project **ATH Open API**

### C. Initialize the sheets (run once)
1. In Apps Script editor, select `initSheets` from the function dropdown
2. Click **Run**
3. Approve all permission prompts
4. Two new tabs appear in the spreadsheet: **Players** and **Schedule**
5. Schedule is pre-populated with all 16 match slots

### D. Deploy as Web App
1. Apps Script → **Deploy → New deployment**
2. Gear icon → **Web app**
3. Settings:
   - Description: `ATH Open API`
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
4. Click **Deploy** → copy the Web App URL (ends in `/exec`)
5. **Important:** save this URL — you'll need it for both `.env` and the GitHub secret

### E. Add pairings to Schedule sheet
After players register, fill in columns E–H (`teamAP1`, `teamAP2`, `teamBP1`, `teamBP2`) with Player IDs from the Players tab. Captains do this before each round starts or in advance.

### F. Redeployment note
If you edit `code.gs` and redeploy, **always edit the existing deployment** (Manage deployments → pencil icon) rather than creating a new one. Creating a new deployment generates a new URL, which requires updating the GitHub secret and rebuilding the frontend.

---

## 7. GitHub Pages Deployment

### One-time setup
1. GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages**
2. Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Save

4. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**
   - Name: `VITE_SHEETS_API_URL`
   - Value: Web App URL from step D above

### Every deploy
Any push to `main` triggers the workflow automatically:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```

Monitor at: https://github.com/spaceshiptrip/ath-open/actions  
Live at: https://spaceshiptrip.github.io/ath-open/

### Manual re-run
Go to Actions tab → click the workflow → **Re-run all jobs** button.

---

## 8. Commit History (what was done and when)

| Commit | Date | What changed |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `af49da4` | Jun 21, 2026 | Initial commit — all 28 files, full app scaffold, backend, CI/CD |
| `213e1d6` | Jun 21, 2026 | Added Athenaeum images: courts hero, logo in header/footer; compressed courts PNG→JPG (4.3MB→124KB) |
| `274b8e4` | Jun 21, 2026 | Swapped team colors: Team A → red, Team B → blue (to match Dodgers logo) |
| `2bf7fb3` | Jun 21, 2026 | Added Team B (Dodgers) logo to Teams page header and Home page team badge |

---

## 9. TODO / Work Remaining

### Must-have before tournament day
- [ ] **Connect Google Sheets** — create spreadsheet, run `initSheets()`, deploy Web App, add GitHub secret, redeploy site
- [ ] **Add real players** — replace mock roster with actual registered players (either via registration form or manually in the Players sheet)
- [ ] **Set match pairings** — fill in player IDs in Schedule sheet columns E–H before each round
- [ ] **Team A logo** — get a logo image for Team A and wire it in the same way as Team B (Teams page + Home badge)

### Nice-to-have
- [ ] **Captain PIN / score lock** — right now anyone can click "Enter Scores" and change results; a simple 4-digit PIN would restrict this to captains only
- [ ] **Auto-refresh scores** — poll the API every 30–60 seconds so live scores update without manual page reload
- [ ] **Player pairing UI** — let captains assign match pairings from within the app instead of editing the spreadsheet directly
- [ ] **Print scorecard** — a print-friendly `/#/print` page with the full schedule and blank score fields for courtside use
- [ ] **Headshot upload** — currently players paste a URL; could add Google Drive file picker or direct upload to a hosting bucket
- [ ] **Player stats** — track individual win/loss per player across all games they played
- [ ] **Mobile score entry** — make the Scores page faster to use on a phone courtside (larger tap targets, swipe to confirm)

---

## 10. Known Issues / Notes

- The `node_modules/` deprecation warning about Node.js 20 in GitHub Actions is cosmetic — the build succeeds. Will auto-resolve when GitHub upgrades runner defaults.
- Source image files (`12511.jpg`, `athenaeum_header_logo.png`, `athenaeum_pickle_courts.png`, `IMG_2787.PNG`) are committed to the repo root. They are not served by the app — the app uses copies in `src/assets/`. These source files can be moved to a `/source-assets/` folder for cleanliness.
- The `.venv/` Python virtual environment is gitignored. It contains `python-docx` and `Pillow`, used during development to read the `.docx` file and compress images.
